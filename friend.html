First time I  got to know her when we both went to school at SK Beluru in 2004. 
At that time, we were both 5 years old. We have been close ever since and then 
we were schoolmate while in high school. Even though we were not a classmate during 
2012-2014, we remained close. In 2015-2016, once again we were destined to be classmates. 
After finishing SPM, we together continue form 6 at PTERMM and also in the same class 
for 1 year and a half. At the end of STPM, we each continue to study at a higher level, 
which is a bachelor's degree. Huda has received an offer at UITM Samarahan, Sarawak. 
Although itâ€™s far away, we often communicate each other through social media such as 
Whatsapp, Instagram and so on. Now, we have been friends for 16 years.</th>

SMK Simpang Beluru. We became close at that time until 2015. Then we were different classes 
in 2015-2016 and our relationship became a little strained. Then Syafiqah also continued her studies 
in form 6 where she and I became classmates. Our relationship became closer again until now even though 
each of us has continued to study elsewhere. Syafiqah got an offer to study at UITM Puncak Perdana, Shah Alam. 
Despite the distance, we also often communicate through social media.</th>

We both knew each other during the orientation in 2019. After that we became close to each other because
 we were classmates at that time until now. Then we became roommate and housemate in 2020 that is during semester 3. 
However, we became housemate and roommate only for a month. This happened due to the outbreak of the disease Covid-19 
and our university had to close as a result of the outbreak. We returned to our hometowns. 
Despite the distance, we often communicate on Whatsapp.</th>
