<h1>My Favorite Drama</h1>

<p>My favorite activity is watching dramas and movies, especially Korean dramas. 
This is because, Korean dramas have various genres such as historical, political, 
action, medical, thriller, suspense, melodrama, romantic and so on.</p>

<p>Apart from the good looking male and female characters, these Korean dramas 
also have many lessons that can be taken as examples.</p>

<p>For example, a medical genre drama. They perform the correct procedures in the process of surgery, 
medicine and so on in the drama. In this case, the drama also can give the audience new knowledge 
and to know various information such as knowing the name of the disease, medicines and so on. 
Not only that, Korean dramas also have an interesting plot and storyline for me to watch it.</p>

<p> So, below is a list of my favorite Korean dramas</p>

<font align="right" size="6">1. Moon Lovers: Scarlet Heart Ryeo (2016)</font>
<br>
<b>
<font align="right" size="4.5">I really like this drama. This drama has historical, romance, fantasy, melodrama and time 
travel genres. This drama tells the story of Go Ha-jin / Hae So, is transported back in time to 
the Goryeo Dynasty. She wakes up in the year of 941 in the body of Hae Soo, among the 
many royal princes of the ruling Wang family during the reign of King Taejo. As long as I 
watch this drama, I feel very excited at first, but in the middle of this drama, many characters 
have died. This has made me feel sad. This drama also has many suspens elements that 
make me want to watch episode to another episode.This drama starring by Lee Joon Gi and Lee Ji Eun (IU).</font>

<font align="right" size="6">2. Uncontrollably Fond (2016)</font>
<br>
<b>
<font align="left" size="4.5">For me, this drama is very sad from the beginning to the last episode because 
the lead actor character in this drama has cancer. Basically, Uncontrollably Fond is about Shin Joon-young, 
a famous actor struggling with illness. Because he is famous, everything he does is always noticed by everyone, e
specially his fans, but he works hard to hide his illness. The drama also shows the conflict that  between 
Joon Young and his motherThis genre of drama is melodrama.This drama is starring by Kim woo bin and Suzy</font>

<font align="right" size="6">3. W: Two Worlds (2016)</font>
<br>
<b>
<font align="right" size="4.5">I really like the concept and plot of this drama which is about two worlds, 
the comic world and the real world. The drama begins when the heroine suddenly enters the computer 
screen which is the world of comics. In that world, she has met the hero of this drama and 
eventually she falls in love with the hero. Just like other dramas, this drama also makes me 
addicted to watching the next episode and beyond. The genre of this drama is fantasy, suspense, thriller 
and supernatural gothic. The drama is starring Lee Jong Suk and Han Hyo Joo.</font>

<font align="right" size="6">4. Hotel Del Luna (2019)</font>
<br>
<b>
<font align="left" size="4.5">This drama is very unique because it tells the story of a hotel located in Seoul, 
and different from other hotels which is the customers are all ghosts, and it cannot be seen in its true form 
during the day. Jang Man Wol as the owner of Hotel Del Luna and Ku Chan-Seong who had to become a manager at the hotel

<br>
<b>
<font align="right" size="4.5">Just like Hotel Del Luna, this drama also has a fantasy genre. Not only that, 
this drama is in the romance genre. This drama is a story about a goblin played by Gong Yoo who was a 
military general in Goryeo era was killed by the king. A few years after he died, he was resurrected and became a goblin.
